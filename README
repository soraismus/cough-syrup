  N.B.: This fork of CoffeeScript by Soraismus only
  minimally modifies the original source code.
  
  The current changes to the code allow

  (1) interposition of spaces
  between functional identifiers and CALL_START tags;

  (2) recognition of implicit left-associative function calls
  (i.e., function calls in applicative order without 
  explicit parentheses or CALL_START/CALL_END tags);

  (3) use of backslashes to indicate the beginning of
  one-parameter parameter lists;

  (4) use of the pattern '\i \j \k ->' to indicate currying
  (i.e, this pattern is rewritten as '(i) -> (j) -> (k) ->');

  (5) use of semicolons to toggle between applicative and
  point-free compositional order (i.e, 'f g h' is equivalent
  to 'f(g)(h)', whereas if 'k = ; f g h', then 'k(0)' is
  equivalent to 'f(g(h(0)))');

  (6) use of additional characters (e.g., '-', '?', '!')
  in INDENTIFIERs' names (To accommodate this change, the four
  existential operators, each of which were formerly represented
  by '?', have been modified: INDEX_SOAK is now '|'; the binary
  existential operator is now '??'; and FUNC_EXISTS and the unary
  existential operator now precede their operands.);

  (7) use of the backtick to immediately compose a pair of
  functions when in applicative mode and to immediately apply
  the first of a pair of functions on the second when in
  compositional mode -- that is,
    *  '; f `g h ;' is interpreted as '(i) -> f(g(h)(i))' and
    *  'f `g h j' is interpreted as 'f((i) -> g(h(i)))(j)'

  CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.

  Install Node.js, and then the CoffeeScript compiler:
  sudo bin/cake install

  Or, if you have the Node Package Manager installed:
  npm install -g coffee-script
  (Leave off the -g if you don't wish to install globally.)

  Execute a script:
  coffee /path/to/script.coffee

  Compile a script:
  coffee -c /path/to/script.coffee
